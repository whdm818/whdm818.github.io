&lt;h2 id=&#34;abstract&#34;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an element analysis technology, atomic spectrometry is widely used in biomedicine, food safety, resources environment, space exploration and other fields. Laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) is a new type of atomic spectroscopy technology, which is favored by many researchers because of its advantages of real-time, non-contact and micro-loss. Due to the non-contact characteristics of LIBS, the position of laser focus relative to the sample surface needs to be precisely controlled in LIBS experiment, which is called LIBS focusing. To solve this problem, this paper builds a LIBS system integrated with a micro-imager, which combines computer vision technology with LIBS technology. Whatâ€™s more, an autofocus method based on surface image acutance is proposed. In addition, the precision and accuracy of LIBS analysis have been the key to limit its application. After the completion of the system, we mainly focused on the precision and accuracy of LIBS quantitative analysis application. The relevant experimental research and calibration methods are carried out. The main contents of this paper include the following aspects:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(1) In order to meet the needs of sample observation and sample position control of LIBS analysis, the LIBS system integrated with a micro-imager is implemented by integrating computer vision and LIBS. The design and implementation of the system are described from two aspects of hardware and software. The design framework of the LIBS system is emphasized, and the optical part of the hardware and the instrument control part of the software are elaborated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(2) According to the needs of LIBS focusing, an autofocus method of LIBS based on the acutance of surface image is proposed. The influence of aperture, region of interest (ROI) and reflectivity of sample surface on the position sensitivity of the surface image are analyzed, and the consistency of the position corresponding to the maximum sharpness of the surface image is verified. On this basis, the autofocus method based on the acutance of surface image is established.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(3) For the precision problem of LIBS analysis, the factors affecting the stability of LIBS signal are analyzed, and the corresponding data processing methods are proposed. The stability of the laser energy and the noise level of the spectrometer are analyzed by using the statistical analysis method combined with the line graph and the histogram. By comparing the stability characteristics of LIBS signals of gas sample and solid sample, the influence of light matter interaction interface on LIBS signals of solid sample is analyzed. For LIBS signals of solid sample with random fluctuation, multiple averaging can be used to improve the stability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(4) For the accuracy problem of LIBS quantitative analysis, the calibration methods related to LIBS quantitative application are studied. Based on the characteristics of LIBS dataset, the overfitting problem in calibration modeling is analyzed. Taking the quantitative analysis of steel as an example, the verification experiment is carried out in combination with the Partial least squares regression (PLSR) multivariate analysis method. The feasibility of PLSR and the importance of dataset segmentation are verified by the analysis results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;abstract&#34;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microfluidic chip, as an important content of micro total analysis system, has become a hot research field in recent years. Microfluidic qPCR technology, based on microfluidic chip, with fast speed, low energy consumption, low pollution, is widely cared by the international experts in the fields of molecular biology and medical diagnostics. Fluorescence imaging is an important method of fluorescence detection of microfluidic qPCR, which get the fluorescence signals of all reaction chambers at the same time. Non-uniform Fluorescence imaging is the main factor affecting quantitative accuracy of qPCR. Based on the analysis of qPCR process, the uniformity requirement of fluorescence imaging has been defined. To acquire more accurate results of qPCR, a fluorescence detection module for Microfluidic qPCR is designed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firstly, based on the mathematical principles of quantitative PCR, the influence of non-uniform fluorescence imaging is analyzed through differential operation. And the uniformity requirement of fluorescence imaging has been defined. Secondly, the factors contributing to the non-uniform fluorescence imaging is analyzed and divided into two parts, the non-uniformity of the excitation process and the non-uniformity of the imaging process. To solve the non-uniformity of the excitation process, the original oblique incident light path is changed into the coaxial incident light path. What&amp;rsquo;s more, the light pipe is used in the incident light path, which is widely used in lithography technology for improving uniformity of excitation light. The main factors are analyzed to solve the non-uniformity of the imaging process. Choosing a suitable camera and optimizing lens parameters setting are convenient and efficient method for improving the uniformity of the imaging process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fluorescence detection module is tested by the fluorescence imaging of sodium fluorescein solution. Compared with the oblique incident light path, light pipe based coaxial incident light path greatly improve the uniformity of fluorescence imaging. What&amp;rsquo;s more, the coaxial structure is convenient for the subsequent expansion, such as the using of filter wheel. Improved fluorescence detection system is also used in the fluorescence signal acquisition of microfluidic qPCR. And the results show that the measurement accuracy meets the requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
